# WGCNA Network Construction

Prior to identifying which genes are correlated with each other, need to select a soft power threshold

: A **soft-power threshold** represents how stringently one can identify correlations between gene expression in two or more samples. Essentially the correlation value of each gene to each other gene will be raised to this number to reduce noise and identify biologically significant correlation.

Select a value that is sufficiently high to reduce biologically meaningless/spurious correlations but not too large to the point where correlations can't be identified. Plot the scale independence and mean connectivity to visualise the effect of different soft power levels on the formation of the adjacency matrix (and hence the network).

Select based on where the plot plateau is, the r^2, and the mean connectivity being below 100

## Soft Power Estimates
```{r soft_power}
set.seed(1201)

powers <- 1:20

sftList <- pickSoftThreshold(placenta_data,
                             powerVector = powers,
                             verbose = 0,
                             networkType = "signed",
                             RsquaredCut = 0.87)

sftList$fitIndices %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 3)))
```

### Soft Power
Plot Soft Power to view if the cut-off is sound
```{r}
ggplot(sftList$fitIndices,
       mapping = aes(x = Power,
                     y = SFT.R.sq,
                     color = "red")) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(colour = "blue",
              se = FALSE,
              linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8736,
             colour = "red") +
  xlab("Soft Threshold (power)") +
  ylab("Scale Free Topology Model Fit, signed R^2") +
  ggtitle("Scale independence") +
  theme_bw() +
  guides(color = "none")
```

### Mean Connectivity
Plot the mean connectivity between nodes (genes)
```{r}
ggplot(sftList$fitIndices,
       mapping = aes(x = Power,
                     y = median.k.,
                     color = "red")) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100,
             colour = "blue") +
  theme_bw() +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Soft Threshold (power)") +
  ylab("Mean Connectivity") +
  ggtitle("Mean connectivity")
```

The `pickSoftThreshold` function suggests the most appropriate soft-thresholding power to be used in network construction. `r sftList$powerEstimate` is the soft-threshold power suggested.


# Module Identification (groups of co-expressed genes)

Next the adjacency matrix will be created for the formation of the gene co-expression network

:   The **adjacency matrix** is a matrix that where the genes are both the columns and rows and the matrix is filled with the correlation value between each pair of genes.

In developing a network, the direction of the correlation of genes is important. The stringency applied when identifying biologically significant modules will increase by only identifying those genes which are positively correlated with one another.

## Topological overlap measurement
Once the network has been constructed, the detection of modules, or groups of co-expressed genes, is the next logical step. As such, modules are defined as clusters of densely interconnected genes, several measures of network interconnectedness exist the **topological overlap measure** (TOM) is used here.

The TOM can be used to cluster genes to form a "gene tree" where clusters of genes can be seen as leaves from the tree. The large matrix of distances between each gene and every other gene can be sorted into these clusters via TOM and hierarchical clustering.

When creating the modules, opt for larger modules for certainty that the genes are actually positively correlated, and so set `minModuleSize` to `40`. Then perform module identification using a hybrid adaptive tree cut

Finally convert numeric lables into colours for preparation of plotting the dendrograms of the clustered modules using `labels2colors`

```{r TOM_matrix}
set.seed(1201)
soft_power <- sftList$powerEstimate

dissTOM <- (1 - (adjacency(placenta_data,
                           power = soft_power,
                           type = "signed") %>%
                   TOMsimilarity(TOMType = "signed")))

geneTree <- dissTOM %>%
  as.dist() %>%
  hclust(method = "average")

minModuleSize <- 40

dynamicMods <- cutreeHybrid(dendro = geneTree, 
                            distM = dissTOM,
                            minClusterSize = minModuleSize,
                            deepSplit = 1,
                            pamStage = FALSE,
                            verbose = 0)

dynamicColors <- labels2colors(dynamicMods$labels)

#rm(dissTOM)
```

Note each module is assigned a colour and **grey represents a module containing non-specific co-expressed genes**. Genes within this module are unlikely to have much relationship to each other therefore is ignored in many downstream analysis.

## Module Eigengenes
In the following steps, module eigengenes and the distances between them are calculated and stored in the list object `MEeigen`.  Module eigengenes are defines as:

:   The first principle component of a certain module

For each gene cluster, the first principle component (which is commonly referred to as a **module eigengene**), is calculated which permits summarisation of the expression pattern of the module of interest. 

:   The module eigengene can be used to correlate the expression of the module with phenotype or biological trait of interest. 

Dissimilarity of module eigengenes are calculated and stored in `MEigen` and module eigengenes are subsequently clustered into `METree`. The recommended distance cutoff to merge modules is 0.25, which corresponds to a correlation of 0.75. Hence the distance threshold, `MEDissThres`, is set to 0.25 and modules differentiating below the threshold will subsequently be merged. The clustering of the placenta modules is then visualised with the distance threshold

```{r module_eigengenes_thresholds, results='hide'}
MEigen <- moduleEigengenes(placenta_data,
                           colors = dynamicColors)

MEDiss <- (1 - cor(MEigen$eigengenes))

METree <- MEDiss %>%
  as.dist() %>%
  hclust(method = "average")

MEDissThres = 0.20

sizeGrWindow(7, 6)
plot(METree,
     main = "Clustering of Placenta modules",
     xlab = "",
     sub = "")
abline(h = MEDissThres,
       col = "red") 
```

The distance threshold is the threshold in which closely related modules, that can subsequently be merged, are idententified. Merging closely related modules is essential as it allows the identification and definition of modules that are truly distinct, and also saves computation time and memory resources.

## Cluster Dendrogram
```{r cluster_dendogram, results='hide' , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
merged_modules <- mergeCloseModules(placenta_data,
                                    dynamicColors,
                                    cutHeight = 0.20, 
                                    verbose = 3)

merged_modules$newMEs %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "ID") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  write_csv(here("data/module_eigengenes.csv"))

merged_modules$colors %>%
  write_rds(here("data/mergedColours.rds"))

merged_modules$colors

mergedColours <- merged_modules$colors

plotDendroAndColors(geneTree,
                    cbind(dynamicColors,
                          mergedColours),
                    c("Dynamic Tree Cut",
                      "Merged dynamic"),
                    dendroLabels = FALSE,
                    hang = 0.03,
                    addGuide = TRUE,
                    guideHang = 0.05,
                    abHeight = 0.8,
                    abCol = "red")
```
